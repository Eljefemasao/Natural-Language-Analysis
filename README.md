  <h1>Overview</h1>
  Our final purpose is to let application reads a document and detects a type of book using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec.
  Depending on input, the output is display as the result like the image below.

  <h2>Files</h2>

  Basic files:  
  <ul>
    <li>analysis.py-which has main function contains implementation of a simple doc2vec.</li>
    <li>create_file.py-extracs train data from directory test_file.</li>
    <li>make_index.py-extracs directory test_file from directory 917.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Major dependiencies are:
  
  <ul>
    <li>python3.6.3</li>
    <li>gensim</li>
    <li>tqdm</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What is Word2Vec</h2>
  Word2Vec is a particularly computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. This model converts target words as vector and it makes model calculates degree of relatedness each other.
